# Question to ask during an interview 

Your questions should cover 4 C's
1. Connect - connect with the interviewer
2. Culture - make sure its the right corporate culture fit for you 
3. Challenges - what are the current challenges the company is facing
4. Close - leave on a high note and be clear on what the next steps are

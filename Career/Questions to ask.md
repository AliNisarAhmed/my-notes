# Question to ask during an interview 

Your questions should cover 4 C's
1. Connect - connect with the interviewer
2. Culture - make sure its the right corporate culture fit for you 
3. Challenges - what are the current challenges the company is facing
4. Close - leave on a high note and be clear on what the next steps are

I think there should be another section of question before 3 and 4, Technical questions.

- Connect examples: 
    - how did you come to work here? 
    - why did you join this company?
    - What do you most love about working here?
- Cuture 
    - Who's the most successful recent hire here, and why is that person successful?
    - Who did not succeed as a new hire, and why?
- Challenges 
    - What's the biggest challenge this year for the company, and how will this job help overcome it?
    - How will I measure my own performance so that I know I'm having a positive impact on this challenge?
- Close 
    - What additional skills or experience do you wish I had that would make me a better fit for this job?
    - What are the next steps in the process?

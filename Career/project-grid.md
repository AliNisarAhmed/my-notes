| Project                   | Birdie Break                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Driving Force                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |  |  |

| Challenges                | Toning down the requirements, the clients wanted in-app chat, payments, notifications, custom picture uploads, an admin portal, so the trick was to keep MVP in mind and develop within limited sprints.                                 | Scale: With thousands of inspections happening per week, the media processing backend azure function as overloaded. With iOS's restricted background activity for apps, background upload became a real challenge for which we had to dive into swift/native code |  |  |  |
| Mistakes / Failures       | Deployment did not proceed as quickly as we would have wanted.                                                                                                                                                                           | Not using Message queues from the beginning, not anticipating scale requirements once the app goes live. The project was underestimated from the get go                                                                                                           |  |  |  |
| Enjoyed                   | Working very closely with the client in a truly agile manner, enjoyed requirement gathering, close collaboration with client/product/design/other devs/leads                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |  |
| Leadership                | I introduced React-hook-form along with yup validation, which made creating forms a breeze                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |  |
| Conflicts                 | Yes, there were conflicts early on about how to structure the app (one teammate was opposed to using RHF and yup, and was also against the use of Context), but since the app was so small, context was sufficient for state management. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |  |
| What you'd do differently | I'd probably use redux from get go. Better screen navigation animations.                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |  |

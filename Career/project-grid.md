| Challenges                | (1) The client had previously failed to launch an app to the appstore with previous developers, owing to various reasons. This, toning down the expectations and requirements was the biggest challenge, the clients wanted in-app chat, payments, notifications, custom picture uploads, an admin portal, so the trick was to keep MVP in mind and develop within limited sprints. | Scale: With thousands of inspections happening per week, the media processing backend azure function as overloaded. With iOS's restricted background activity for apps, background upload became a real challenge for which we had to dive into swift/native code                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mistakes / Failures       | Deployment did not proceed as quickly as we would have wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not using Message queues from the beginning, not anticipating scale requirements once the app goes live. The project was underestimated from the get go                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Enjoyed                   | (1) Working very closely with the client in a truly agile manner (2) enjoyed requirement gathering, close collaboration with client/product/design/other devs/leads. (3) The project was free of bugs, so we actually used the extra sprint reserved for fixing bugs to implement the payment and SMS notifications feature.                                                        | Collaboration with FE dev and Designer. We installed little wheels in our workstations that allowed mobiliity for team members to sit in a secluded area and collaborate. The freedom to architect back-end and front-end code.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Leadership                | I introduced React-hook-form along with yup validation, which made creating forms a breeze                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | (1) I acted as the tech lead at the end of the project, when the current lead switched to a different project. (2) Introduced UI testing to teammates (3) (3) Used azure message queues to improve performance (4) Used Recycler list on React native to improve performance.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Conflicts                 | Yes, there were conflicts early on about how to structure the app (one teammate was opposed to using RHF and yup, and was also against the use of Context), but since the app was so small, context was sufficient for state management.                                                                                                                                            | Implementing background upload took a lot longer than everyone anticipated, which lead to longer work days, thus unhappy workers and client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| What you'd do differently | I'd probably use redux from get go. Better screen navigation animations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | (1) Use message queues from start. (2) Identify high risk areas in a project and implement them first and foremost. We thought bg-upload was a done deal since there were libraries out there than handled our use case, but then at actual implementation time we found out that no library was perfect and we needed a custom solution. (3) Better SOW and estimation from the get go. (4) Tone down hard technical requirements |

| Challenges                | (1) OId legacy system built on MS Dynamics 365 which has grown too big and now is hard to maintain and change. (2) The devs who wrote it are no longer there, the code is kinda mish/mash and maintainers are finding it hard to change the system |
| Mistakes/Failures         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Enjoyed                   | Collaboration, my Team is good, especially my Team lead who I enjoy working with                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Leadership                | Evaluating whether to re-write the app, or even stay on the current stack, or use a different CRM (2) Participating in Event storing sessions to model the domain and identify events, Bounded Contexts, workflows, triggers etc.                  |
| Conflicts                 | The old nature of the existing project leads to different ideas on how to implement/improve things.                                                                                                                                                |

| Challenges                | - The biggest challenge was the scale of the project, with millions of login per day it was absolutely vital to not break anything at all and keep the functionality running<br><br>- We had to do this migration over the peak period, OpEx was a real challenge<br><br>- Working with many different teams like Identity, Account Selector, QBO SRE was a challenge | - Scale of the project, without millions of calls per day to Id1.0 APIs<br><br>- Working with cross functional teams across different timezones<br><br>- Technically had to learn a LOT of domain knowledge to understand migrating the difficult part                              |
| Enjoyed                   | Learning how to handle OpEx at such a large scale, one of the most valuable things I could learn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - The difficulty and scale of the project<br><br>- Getting to know both QBO domain and Identity domain for migration<br><br>- Learning OpEx best practices (how to monitor, how to debug with logs, how to measure performance with logs, how to set up alerts and on-call etc etc) |
| Mistakes & Learnings      | - We migrated the project in two phases - one was migration to Simplified Login, and then later we moved to target start with Consolidated Signin, IMO we should have directly moved to target state<br><br>- Teams relying too much on Monolith APIs, which is still a problem to this day.                                                                          | - Too many mistakes happened when writing the data mappers which could have been avoided<br><br>- I made a number of small silly mistakes that led to small production incidents (nothing major though), could have done better                                                     |

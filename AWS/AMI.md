# AMI 

Amazon Machine Image are a customization of an EC2 instance

- we can add our own software, configuration, OS, monitoring etc.

AMIs are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)

We can launch EC2 instances from 
    - a public AMI - AWS provided
    - our own AMI - we make and maintain them ourselves
    - an AWS marketplace AMI

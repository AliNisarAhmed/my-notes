# Step Functions

Orchestrate the components of a microservices app of any process into a serverless workflow

Step function allows us to represent workflows as a State machine, which we can visually inspect.

Amazon uses Amazon States Language (ASL) for writing state machine, but we can also use drag-and-drop interface

## Step function state types

1. Task
    - Single unit of work
2. Choice
    - if else logic
3. Parallel
    - begin parallel branches of execution
4. Wait
    - add delay
5. Fail
    - stop execution and mark as failure
6. Succeed
    - stop execution and mark as success
7. Pass
    - pass input from previous state to the next state
8. Map
    - map the current state with a function, iterate on it


## Use Cases

1. Built-in retry and error handling capabilities
    - we can split multiple Lambda calls into multiple states and handle errors happening in any individual lambda function
2. Suitable for handling long running jobs
    - Lambda functions have an execution limit of 15 minutes
    - We can break down a lambda into multiple states each of which can execute for 15 minute and pass its result to the next state


### Question

A transcoding media service is being developed on Amazon Cloud. Photos uploaded to Amazon S3 will trigger a Lambda function. The Lambda function will cause the Step Functions to coordinate a series of processes that will do the image analysis tasks. The input of each function should be preserved on the result to conform to the applicationâ€™s logic flow.

What should the developer do?

Answer: Declare a `ResultPath` field filter on the Amazon States Language specification.

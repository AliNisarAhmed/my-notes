### Abstract Data Types vs Data Structures

**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is the mathematical model for data types (e.g. stack, hashmap).

**Data Structure** is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

**ADT** is an abstract description of how a specific set of data can be organization and which operations can be performed on that set of data.

while **Data Structure** is a specific and concrete implementation of the ADT, e.g. using JS arrays to represent stack.

# GoF Design Pattern Categories

## Creational

1. **Abstract Factory** - A pattern for the creation of objects belonging to a family of classes. The specific object is determined at runtime.
2. **Builder** - A useful pattern for more complex objects where the construction of the object is controlled externally to the constructed class.
3. **Factory Method** - A pattern for creating objects derived from a class where the specific class is determined at runtime.
4. **Prototype** - A pattern for copying or cloning an object.
5. **Singleton** - A pattern for enforcing only one instance of a class.

## Structural

1. **Adapter** - A pattern for providing a match between two different classes.
2. **Bridge** - A pattern for allowing the implementation details of a class to be replaced without requiring the class to be modified.
3. **Composite** - Used to create a hierarchy of classes in a tree structure.
4. **Decorator** - A pattern for replacing the functionality of a class at runtime
5. **Facade** - A pattern used to simplify complex systems
6. **Flyweight** - A pattern used to reduce the resource usage for complex models
7. **Proxy** - A pattern used to represent another object allowing for an additional level of control between the calling and called objects
   
## Behavioral patterns

1. **Chain of Responsibility** -  A pattern for handling a request between a collection of objects
2. **Command** - A pattern used to represent a request
3. **Interpreter** - A pattern for defining syntax or language for instructions in a program
4. **Iterator** - A pattern for traversing a collection of items without detailed knowledge of the elements in a collection
5. **Mediator** - A pattern for simplifying communication between classes
6. **Memento** - A pattern for capturing and storing the state of an object
7. **Observer** - A pattern for allowing objects to be notified of changes to another object's state
8. **State** - A pattern for altering an object's behavior when its state changes
9. **Strategy** - A pattern for implementing a collection of algorithms where a specific algorithm can be applied at runtime
10. **Template Method** - A pattern for defining the steps of an algorithm while leaving the implementation details in a subclass
11. **Visitor** - A pattern promoting loose coupling between data and functionality, allowing for additional operations to be added without requiring changes to the data classes

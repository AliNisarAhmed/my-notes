- fd00::1000:689:9000:cdf
	- fd00:0000:0000:0000:1000:0689:9000:0cdf

- ff02::2
	- ff02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0002

- ::1
	- 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001

## EUI-64

![[Pasted image 20230521110524.png]]

Great explanation [here](https://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/04/eui-64-ipv6/)

The host portion generated from EUI-64 is then attached to network address to generate a full unique IPv6 address for the interface
- so instead of manually assigning IPs like in IPv4 (or automatically with DHCP), IPv6 interfaces can generate their own unique IPv6 addresses using their MAC addresses.

### Why Invert the 7th bit

### Practice

- 782b cbac 0867
	- 782b cbff feac 0867
	- invert: 7a2b cbff feac 0867
- 0200 4c4f 4f50
	- 0000 4cff fe4f 4f50
- 0050 56c0 0001
	- 0250 56ff fec0 0001

## Types

### 1. Global unicast addresses

![[Pasted image 20230521112555.png]]
^ black outline: network identifier


### 2. Unique local addresses

like Private IPv4 addresses

![[Pasted image 20230521114524.png]]


### 3. Link local addresses

![[Pasted image 20230521114721.png]]

*link-local* means that these addresses are used for communication within a single link (subnet)
- Routers *will not* route packets with a link-local destination IPv6 addr

Common uses
- routing protocol peerings (OSPFv3 uses link-local addresses for neighbor adjacencies)
- next-hop addresses for static routes
- Neighbor Discovery protocol (NDP, IPv6's replacement for ARP) uses link-local addresses to function

![[Pasted image 20230521115415.png]]
^ R1 cannot ping R3 using link-local address, however, their use as next-hop address is allowed


### 4. Multicast addresses

![[Pasted image 20230521115518.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230521115524.png]]

#### Multicast address scopes

![[Pasted image 20230521115756.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230521115816.png]]

Organization Local scope and Global scope boundaries are defined by network engineer and must be configured

![[Pasted image 20230521115958.png]]
^ FF02::1 is the all nodes multicast group
^ FF02::2 is the all routers multicast group


### 5. Anycast addresses

![[Pasted image 20230521120602.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230521120620.png]]


### 6. Unspecified address

denoted by all zeroes `::`
- can be used when a device does not yet know its IPv6 address
- IPv6 default routes are configured to `::/0`
- IPv4 equivalent `0.0.0.0`


### 7. Loopback address

`::1` (127 zeroes followed by 1)
- used to test the protocol stack on the local device
- Messages sent to this address are processed within the local device, but not sent to other devices
- IPv4 equivalent `127.0.0.0/8`



## Configuration

Enable by using `ipv6 unicast-routing`

Most of the ipv6 commands are same as ipv4 commands, but instead of `ip` they use `ipv6`
- e.g. `ipv6 address <ip_address>`
- `show ipv6 interface brief`

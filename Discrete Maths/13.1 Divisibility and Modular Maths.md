# Divisibility and Modular Maths 

## Division

When $a$ and $b$ are $\in \Z$ with $a ≠ 0$ , we say $a$ divides $b$ if $\exist c (ac=b)$ 

- $a$ is a _factor_ of $b$
- $b$ is a _multiple_ of $a$ 
- notation: $a \mid b$ 
- does not divide notation: $a \nmid b$ 

#### Example

Let $n$ and $d$ be positive integers. How many positive integers not exceeding n are divisible by d?

- all +ve integers divisble by $d$ are of the form $dk$ , where $k \in Z^+$ 
- Hence the number of +ve Ints that do not exceed n equals number of integers k such that $0 < dk ≤ n$ 
    - or, can also be written as $0 < k ≤ n / d$ 
- Thus, to count number of $k$ between 0 and $n/d$, we take floor of $n/d$
- $\therefore$ number of +ve Ints not exceeding $n$ divisible by $d$ = $\lfloor{n / d}\rfloor$ 
- So for example. number of Ints divisble by 3 within 100 are $\lfloor 100 / 3 \rfloor = 33$ 

### Division Theroems

1. if $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$ then $a \mid (b + c)$ (7 | 49 and 7 | 63 then 7 | 112)
2. if $a \mid b$ then $a \mid b c$ for all Ints $c$ 
3. if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ then $a \mid c$ 
4. if $a \mid b \land a \mid c$ then $a \mid mb + nc$ 

### Division Algorithm (also called Quotient-Remainder theorem)


let $a \in Z \land d \in \Z^+$ 
- then there are unique Integers $q$ and $r$ 
    - with $r < d$ and $r ≥ 0$ ($r$ is always +ve between 0 and (but smaller than) $d$)
    - such that $a = dq + r$ 
    - where 
        - $d$ is called _divisor_ (The one that divides)
        - $a$ is called _dividend_ (The one that is being divided)
        - $q$ is _quotient_
        - $r$ is _remainder_
        
Notation for quotation and remainder 
 - q = a div d
 - r = a mod d

Note that
- both `a div d`and `a mod d` are functions from $Z \to Z$ for a fixed $d$ 

Also Note 
- when $a \in Z \land d \in Z^+$ 
    - then `a div d` = $\lfloor a /d \rfloor$ 
    - and `a mod d` = $a - d$ (????)

example: $101 = 11 . 9 + 2 \to q = 9; r = 2$ (101 dividend, 11 divisor)
example: $-11 = 3(-4) + 1 \to q = -4; r = 1$ ($r$ cannot be -ve, $r$ must be between 0 and 3)

## Modular Arithmetic

### Congruences

If $a$ and $b$ and Ints and $m \in Z^+$ 
    then **a is congruent to b modulo m**
    if m divides $a-b$ , that is $m \mid a - b$ 
    
Notation: $a\equiv b \pmod m$ 

we say that  $a \equiv b \pmod m$ is a **congruence** and that $m$ is its **modulus**

Opposite Notation: $a \not\equiv b \pmod m$ 

###### Congruence Modulo in words 

- When we say $a \equiv b \pmod c$, what we mean is that when $a$ and $b$ are both divided by $c$, they leave the same remainder (not necessarily $a$ or $b$)
    - for example: $26 \equiv 11 \pmod 5$, (remainder == 1)
- The following statements are equivalent 
    - $A \equiv B \pmod C$ 
    - $A \bmod C = B \bmod C$ 
    - $C | (A - B)$ 
    - $A = B + K \times C$ 

##### Difference between Congurence and `mod`

- $a \equiv b\pmod m$ represents a relation on the set of integers (a relation is a two-tuple like (a, b))
- while `a mod m = b` is a function: $Z \to Z$ 
- why we say that _Congruence modulo C is an equivalence relation_. It partitions the integers into **C different equivalence classes**.
    - Example, $\pmod 2$ divides the numbers into evens and odds classes

However, the two are also closely related 

#### Theorem 

if $a$ and $b$ are Ints, and $m \in Z^+$ , then $a \equiv b\pmod m \iff a \bmod m = b \bmod m$ 

Example: is $17 \equiv 5 \pmod 6$ ? 
    - 17 - 5 = 12 mod 6 = 0, hence the above is true 
Example: is $24 \equiv 14 \pmod 6$ ? 
    - 24 - 14 = 10 mod 6 ≠ 0, hence the above is false

##### Corollary 

if $a \bmod m = b \bmod m$ , then $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $m$

or 

$a \bmod m = km + r$ and $b \bmod m = jm + r$ 

#### Theroem 

$a \equiv b \pmod m \iff a = b + km$ where $m \in Z^+$ 

#### Theorem 

$a \equiv (a \bmod m) \pmod m$ 

### Congruence Class 
The Set of all Integers congruent to an integer $a$ modulo $m$ is called **congrence class**

#### Theorem 

This theorem shows that additions and multiplcations preseve congruences

let $m \in Z^+$ 
if 
    $a \equiv b \pmod m$
and 
    $c \equiv d \pmod m$ 
then 
    $a + c \equiv b + d \pmod m$ 
and 
    $ac \equiv bd \pmod m$ 

Example: 
    because 
        $7 \equiv 2 \pmod 5$ and 
        $11 \equiv 1 \pmod 5$ then 
- $7 + 11 = 18 \equiv 3 \pmod 5$ 
- $7.11 = 77 \equiv 2 \pmod 5$ 


Important: Some apparent properties may not hold with Congruences

e.g. if $ac \equiv bc \pmod m$ then $a \equiv b \pmod m$ may be false 
similarly if $a \equiv b\pmod m \land c \equiv d \pmod m$ then $a^c \equiv b^d \pmod m$ may not be true

#### Corollary 

$(a + b) \bmod m = ( (a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$ 

$ab \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) . (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$ 

## Arithmetic Modulo m

we can define arithmetic operations on the set $Z_m = \{0, 1, … , m - 1\}$ such as 

$a +_m b = (a + b) \bmod m$ 

$a ._m b = (a . b) \bmod m$ 

Example: 
$7 +_{11} 9 = (7 + 9) \bmod 11 = 16 \bmod 11 = 5$ 
$7 ._{11} 9 = (7 . 9) \bmod 11 = 63 \bmod 11 = 8$ 

These Arithmetic modulo m operations satisfy the following properties

- **Closure**: $a \land b \in Z_m \implies a +_m b \in Z_m \land a ._m b \in Z_m$ 
- **Associativity** a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- **Commutativity**: a + b = b + a
- **Identity**: $0$ and $1$ 
- **Additive Inverse**: 
    - $a +_m (m - a) = 0$ (a and (m - a) are additive inverse)
    - $0 +_m 0 = 0$ (0 is its own additive inverse)
- **Distributivity**: (a + b) . c = (a . c) + (b . c)

Note that multiplicative inverse does not always exist modulo m.

#### Some Identities

- if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ , then either $a = b \lor a = -b$ 
- if $a \mid c \land b \mid c \implies ac \mid bd$ 
- if $a,b \in Z$ and $a \mid b$ , then either $a$ is odd or $b$ is even

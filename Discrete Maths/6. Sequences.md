# Sequences

A `sequence` is a function from a subset of the set of integers $\Z$ to a set $S$. 

$$a_n$$ denotes image of the integer $n$ 

$a_n$ is called `term` of the sequence


## Geometric Progression 

$a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, … , ar^n, ...$ 
    where a = initial term  r = common ratio
    

## Arithmetic Progression 

$a, a + d, a + 2d, … , + a + nd + …$  
    where a = initial term r = common difference
    
## Recurrence Relation 
an RR for the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an equation that expresses the `nth` term $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence i.e. $a_0, a_1, a_n-1$ 

### Solution of an RR 

An equation for a sequence is a solution of an RR if its terms satisfy the RR

### Initial Conditions of RR: 
specifies the terms that precede the first term where the RR takes effect.
– An RR with Initial Conditions determines a unique solution

### Examples of IC and RR 

#### fibonacci seq: 
defined by Initial Condition $f_0 = 0$ and $f_1 = 1$ and the RR 
$f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$  for n = 2, 3, 4... 

#### Compound Interest 
RR => $P_n = P_{n-1} + rP_{n-1}$
Solution => $P_n = r^nP_0$

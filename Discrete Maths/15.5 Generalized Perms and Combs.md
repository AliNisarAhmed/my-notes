# Generalized Permutations and Combinations 

These include scenarios like counting problems involve indistinguishable elements, or some elements may be used repeatedly.

## Permutations with repitition

The number of $r$-perms of a set of $n$ objects with repitition allowed is $n^r$ 

Example: How many strings of length $r$ can be formed with the uppercase letters of English?
    - 26 x 26 x 26 ... r times (since repitition is allowed)
    - Hence: $26^r$ 

## Combinations with repitition

There are $C(n + r -1, r) = C(n + r - 1, n - 1)$ r-combs from a set with $n$ elements when repitition of elements is allowed.

Example: How many ways are there to select 4 pieces of fruit from { apples, oranges, pears }, if the order does not matter, only the type of fruit and not the individual piece matters, and there are at least four pieces of each type of fruit in the bowl?
    - Possibilities: 4 apples, 3apples 1Orange, 2A2O, 1A3O... and so on 
    - The solution is the 4-comb with repitition allowed from a 3 element set (n = 3, r = 4) 
    - answer = $C(3 + 4 -1, 4) = C(6, 4) = 6 \times 5 / 2 = 15$ 


Example: Suppose that a cookie shop has 4 different kinds of cookies. How many different ways can 6 cookies be chosen? order and individual cookies do not matter, only type of cookie.
    - here $n = 4, r = 6$ 
    - answer: $C(4 + 6 - 1, 6) = C(9, 3) = 9 \times 8 \times 7 / 3! = 84$ 


Example: How many solutions does the equation (non-neg integers only) $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 11$ 
    - note that the solution corresponds to a way of selecting 11 items from a set with 3 elements so that $x_1$ items of type one, $x_2$ items of type two, and $x_3$ items of type 3 are chosen.
    - Hence, the number of solutions = number of 11-combs with repitition allowed from a set with 3 elements.
    - n = 3, r = 11
    - $C(3 + 11 - 1, 11) = C(13, 11) = C(13, 2) = 78$

## Permutations with Indistinguishable objects 

Some elements may be indistinguishable in counting problems. When this is the case, care must be taken to avoid counting things more than once.

# Proofs

#### Terms

- **Theorem**: A statement that can be shown to be true 
- **Proposition**: less important theorems 
- **Proof**:  a valid argument that establishes the truth of a theorem
- **Axioms**: Statements assumed to be true 
- **Lemma**: less important theorem used to prove a theorem

## Direct Proof 

- to prove $p \to q$ , assume $p$ is $true$ and show that $q$ is $true$  

## Indirect Proofs 

#### Proof by Contraposition

- to prove $p\to q$ , we prove $\neg q \to \neg p$ 
- assume $q$ is $false$, and then show that $p$ is also $false$ 

#### Vacuous Proof 

- if $p$ is shown to be $false$, then $p \to q$ becomes $true$ (by the definition and truth table of $p \to q$ )

#### Trivial Proof 

- if $q$ is shown to be $true$ , then by definition of conditional $p \to q$ is $true$.

#### Proof by Contradiction 

Two ways of proceeding with this: 

1. to show that $p \to q$ is $true$, we show $\neg p \to (r \land \neg r)$ , this means we show that if $p$ is $false$ , then a proposition $r$ is both $true$ and $false$ , a contradiction, therefore, $p$ must be $true$ . 
2. Assume that $p$ and $\neg q$ are both $true$ (i.e. $q$ is $false$), then we show that $q$ is also $true$, which leads to the contradiction $(q \land \neg q)$ , hence $q$ must be true, which means $p \to q$ must also be true.

#### Exhaustive Proof & Proofs by cases 

- Prove a theorem for all possible cases 
- $(p_1 \lor p_2 \lor p_3 … p_n) \to q \iff [(p_1 \to q) \land (p_2 \to q) \land (p_3 \to q) … \land (p_n \to q)]$ 

#### Existence Proofs 

- we have to prove $\exist x P(x)$ 
- finding a witness $a$ such that $P(a)$ , is called `constructive` proof. 
- `Non-Constructive Proof`: we show that $\exist x P(x)$ is $true$ , without finding a specific witness $a$ for which $P(a)$ is true.
    - This is usually done through logical deduction to show that there must be a solution, but we do not actually specify a solution. (Example: proving that the first player in the game of Chomp, we can do it without actually specifying a strategy for the first player )

#### Uniqueness Proofs 

- We show that $\exist x (P(x) \land \forall y (y ≠ x \to \neg P(y)))$ 
- Uniqueness Proofs have two parts 
    - Existence -> element $x$ with the desired property $P(x)$ exists 
    - Uniqueness -> if $x$ and $y$ both have desired property (i.e. $P(x) = true \land P(y) = true$ ), then $x$ must be equal to $y$.

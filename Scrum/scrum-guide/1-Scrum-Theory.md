# Scrum Thoery

## Scrum Definition

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
● For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
● For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
● For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.
These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their
stakeholders.



## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from
experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses
on the essentials.

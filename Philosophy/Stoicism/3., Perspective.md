# Perspective 

```
These are the two ideas you should keep at the very front of your mind and think about. One is that things in the world do not touch your spirit, but stand quietly external to it; that which disturbs us comes only from opinions within us. Second, everything you see changes in a moment and will soon be gone. Keep in mind always how many of these changes you have already see. The world is constant change; your life lies in your opinion.

Marcus Aurelius
```

Viewing a proble, an adversary, or oneself from a certain perspective - seeing it from far away, or as part of a bigger picture - can sometimes detach us from an appetite or fear without need for analysis. 

By seeing how our affairs look in the larger scheme of things, the Stoic means to induce a felt sense of humility and attraction to virtue. This method can be called **intuitive** (as opposed to analytical) beacuse it's not a matter of argument. It's more a question of showing and pointing, and expecting perceptions and adjustments to follow directly from a new point of view.

If you wanted to convince ants to work together rather than obsess about individual glory, you might start by showing them how they look to us.

## Time 

```
You can get rid of a great number of your annoyances because they lie entirely in your own head. You will clear ample space for yourself by comprehending the scale of the universe in your mid, by observing the infinity of time, and by studying carefully the rapid change of each part of each thing - how short the time is from birth to dissolution, the time before it an abyss, the time afterwards also endless. 

Aurelius
```

```
Imagine the vast abyss of time, and think of the enire universe; then compare what we call a human lifetime to that immensity. You will see how tiny a thing it is that we wish for and seek to prolong.

Seneca
```

```
We live for an instance, even less than an instant. But nature adds mockery to even this trivial span by giving it an appearance of longer extent - making one part infancy, another childhood, another youth, another the gradual slope (so to speak) from youth to old age, another age itself. How many steps for so short a climb!

Seneca
```

## Perishability 

The scale of time and space makes all human doings seem small. To this the Stoic adds that such doings are also highly perishable: all human works, and for that matter  all works of nature, soon change and are gone. This perspective is a help toward detachment from externals.

## Repitition 

```
So for everything that happens, keep this in mind: it is something you have seen many times before. Look up and down, in short, and you will find the same things that the histories are filled with - ancient histories, histories of intervening years, histories of our times - and that fill the cities and the houses of today. Nothing is new; everything is both familiar and short-lived.

Aurelius
```

```
Carefully consider the past - the countless changes of political regimes. You can also see future events in advance; they will be of entirely the same kind, for it is impossible to depart from the pattern of what is happening now. It follows that to have observed human life for forty years is the same as ten thousand years. For what more are you going to see?

Aurelius
```

## The overhead view 

```
Look down from above on the countless gatherings and contless ceremonies, and every sort of voyage in storm and calm, and the disputes between those being born, living together, and dying. Think also of the life that was lived by others long ago, and that will be lived after you, and that is being lived now in other countries; think of how many don't know your name at all, how many will quickly forget it, how many who - perhaps praising you now - will soon be finding fault. Realize that being remembered has no value, nor does your reputation, nor anything else at all. 

Aurelius
```

We believe these affairs of ours are great because we are small

# Death

Death has two kinds of significance for stoics 
    - First, it is an external 
    - Second, it is the most frightening prospect the mind confronts

Stoics consider death as hard to see accurately, and they find the usual attitude toward it irrational. 

What death is like is unknown to anyone, but it appears to be a painless state that leaves us no worse off than we were before we were born.

They also consider death as a continuous process rather than sudden one.

But, it is also a source of perspective and inspiration - a valuable aid, not just something to which we overreact.

## Fear of death 

What we must overcome is not death, but the way we think about it (fear)

```
Neither death nor pain is to be feared, but the fear of pain or death .. Confidence should therefore be our attitude toward the fear of it. But now we have the opposite: toward death, avoidance; toward our opinions about it, carelessness, indifference and neglect.

Epictetus
```

## Correctives to fear 

The stoic approach to the fear of death is the same as to other externals; use reason to see the thing clearly, and peel away its frightening features.

## Comparisons to the time before birth

One response to fear of death is to contemplate its similarity to our position before birth, which we have no reason to think was difficult.

```
"What?" I say to myself; "does death so often test me? Let it do so; I myself have for a long time tested death." "When?" you ask. Before I was born ... Unless I am mistaken, my dear Lucilius, we go astray in thinking that death follows, when it has both preceded and will follow. Whatever condition existed before our birth, was death. For what does it matter whether you do not begin at all, or whether you end, when the result in either case is non-existence?

Seneca
```

## The progressive character of death

```
We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance toward it by slight degrees. We die every day. For every day a little of our life is taken from us; even when we are growing, our life is on the wane. We lose our childhood, then our boyhood, and then our youth. Right up to the yesterday, all past time is lost time; the very day we are now spending is share between ourselves and death. 

It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that has flowed our already.

Seneca
```

```
Why fear you last day? It does no more to advance you toward death than any other day did. The last step does not cause your fatigue; it reveals your fatigue. Every day is a step toward death. The last one arrives there. 

Montaigne
```

## The availability of death 

The stoics regard death as an as an option rather than a terror. The option becomes a source of courage in life. The ability to end one's life is therefore an important freedom. 

If life is intolerant, as Epictetus puts it, "the doorway out is open".

However: 

```
We need to be warned and strenthened in both directions - not to love or to hate life overmuch. Even when reason advises us to make an end of it, the impulse is not to be adopted without relfection or headlong speed. The brave and wise man should not flee from life but withdraw from it. 

Seneca
```

## Duration vs Quality 

The impression that death lies in the distance can create a desire to keep it there, or as far away as possible - to treat the length of a life as the most important thing about it. The stoic, on the other hand, is more concerned with quality of life than its duration.

Virtue and honor are goods not measured in time; the person who has them has lived long enough.

```
Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long. 

Seneca
```

```
It is with life as with a play; what matter is not how long it is, but how good. It makes no difference at what point you stop. Leave off where you choose; just be sure to give it a good ending.

Seneca
```

## Death as a universal equalizer 

Stoics find consolation for death in the reflection that it is a fate common to everyone. 

Death equalizes all people, which might encourage magnanimity in life.

```
Why are you angry with your slave, with your master, with your patron, with your client? Wait a little. Behold, death comes, which will make you all equal.

Seneca
```

## The proximity of death

Once the fear of it is subdued, death is regarded by the stoics as a resource - a remedy for pride and a teach of wisdom. They therefore pursue a kind of closeness with death rather than distance from it. 

Stoics observe that the possibility of death is nearer than we imagine, a point offered not to cause anxiety but to dispel it; rather than a frightening thing that advances on us, death is next to us all the time. It is best accepted as a reason to live well in the time that remains.

## Mortality as inspiration

Reflection on death, as we have seen, is viewed by the Stoic as a way to reduce the fear of it, but also as a cause for urgency in living and a source of inspiration. 

```
The perfection of moral character consists in this: to spend each day as if it were the last, to be neighter agitated nor numb, and not to pretend. 

Aurelius
```

```
You are going to die at any minute, and yet you still are not simple and straighforward, nor do you have peace of mind, nor are you free from suspicion that you will be hurt by external things, nor are you kind to everyone, nor do you see that being wise consists solely in being just. 

Aurelius
```

```
We must make it our aim to have already lived long enough.

Seneca
```

```
Take as much Fortune gives, remembering that it comes with no gaurantee. Snatch the pleasures your children bring, let your children in turn find delight in you, and drain joy to the dregs without delay; nothing is promised for this night - nay, I have granted too long an extension! - not even for this hour. We must hurry, the enemy is right behind us!

Seneca
```

# Judgement

The first principle of Stoicism is this: 
    we don't react to events, we react to our judgements about them, and the judgements are up to us. 
    
```
If any external thing causes you distress, it is not the thing itself that troubles you, but your own judgement about it. And this you have the power to eliminate now. 

Aurelius
```

The stoic claim is that our pleasures, griefs, desires, and fears all involve three stages rather than two: not just an _event_ and a _reaction_, but an event, then a judgement or opinion about it, and then a reaction (to the judgement or opinion). 

Our task is to notice the middle step, to understand its frequent irrationality, and to control it through the patient use of reason.

This point is foundational and most of what stoics say depend on it.

The truth of the stoic claim is easiest to see when we react to an offense given strictly to the mind. Suppose someone insults you. The insult itself is meaningless apart from what you make of it. If you are bothered, it must be because you care, a judgement,

Physical pain is real, a sensation that exists no matter what we think about it. But how much bother it causes, how much attention we pay to it, what it means to us, there are judgements, and all for us to determine.

Some of these judgements are things that we say and convince ourselves about, but some others are ingrained, fixed and subconscious.


```
Everything depends on opinion. Ambition, luxury, greed, all look back to opinion; it is according to opinion that we suffer. Each man is as wretched as he has convinced himself he is.

Seneca
```

```
Men are disturbed not by the things that happen but by their opinions about those things. 

For example, ddeath is nothing terrible, for if it were, it would have seemed so to Socrates. Rather, the opinion that death is terrible - that is the terrible thing. So when we are imeded or upset or aggrieved, let us never blame others, but ourselves, our opinions.

Epictetus
```

## Practice

Although this claim sounds elementary, it is foundational, and fundamental to stoic practice, because for most people (including me), the default is to let thoughts pass through with no more scrutiny than we give to the air we breathe.

```
Take away your opinion about it, and "I have been harmed" is taken away. Take away "I have been harmed", and the harm is taken away.

M. Aurelius
```

```
What is important? To raise your life high above chance occurences and to remember that it is a human life - so that if you are fortunate, you know this will not last long; or if you are unfortunate, you know that you are'nt really, if you don't think you are.

Seneca
```

This claim is not to enocourage a kind of vacuity or indifference, the goal os not to empty the mind, but to clear it of foolishness, misjudgement, bias, irrational thoughts. Most of the people mentioned so far were some of the most important people of their time.

## Comparison

The stoics start by comparing our own reactions to similar things in different circumstances. If a reaction that seems natural is'nt found elsewhere, maybe it is'nt so natural.

```
The mere fact that men endure the same pain more easily when the voluntarily undergo it for the sake of their country than when they suffer it for some lesse cause, shows that the intensity of the pain depends on the state of the mind of the sufferer, not on its own intrinsic nature.

Cicero
```

```
We are more sensitive to a cut made by a surgeon's scalpel than to ten wounds by sword in the heat of battle. 

Montaigne
```

***

```
Like a bowl of water, so is the soul; like the light falling on the water, so are the impressions the soul receives. When the water is disturbed, the light also seems to be disturbed; yet it is not disturbed.

Epictetus
```

```
An idea that deceives the mass of mankind - that is they could live in big houses, and get together enough slaves and money, they would have a happy life. But a happy life and cheerful life does not come from without. (It comes from within).

Plutarch

# Empathy & Concern

Where does compassion in humans come from?
- maybe we are related to other people whom we show compassion?
- some religious code?
- But most likely, we are wired up to care about other people

Empathy plays an important role in driving compassion, and driving morality.
- This idea is found in Adam Smith
- He gives an example, where if someone is about to get hurt, we wince just looking at the scene

Our propensity to imitate others, in actions, facial expressions, body language, verbally, physically, also drives empathy.

The fact that empathetic connections with individuals boost up your feelings towards them is the spark of an effect called _identifiable victim effect_.
- the idea that we care a lot more when there's a person in from of us than some numbers.
- "A single death is tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic"
- "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will"

Empathy drives compassion, both at individual level but also at the group level too.
- normalizing gay people in TV shows changed people's opinion of them
- Reading fictional accounts of how slaves felt helped reduced slavery

In support of this, we could look at what's wrong with people who don't care about other people, called psychopaths.
- they tend to be selfish, callous, impulsive, promiscuous

In an experiment, psychopaths were shown faces of people who were either happy, sad, angry, surprised, afraid, disguted
- Psychopaths had trouble identifying only one emotion, fear!
- Psychopaths have this specific deficit, empathizing with the fear of other people,

# Compassion - Caring for others

Compassionate is someone you could call caring, concern, fellow feeling, the idea that other people matter to us.

Empathy is often regarded as the source of compassion or source of all morality.

### Perfect Psychopath

Imagine a perfect psychopath
- highly intelligent
- normal set of emotions and desires
- totally lack compassion, feelings for others
- Although not a sadist, if we wants something, he WILL try to get it, not matter the otucome for others

How would we convince him to be a good person?

We can try to see him that when he harms people, other people can harm him too, how would he feel then
- he would say that he would hate that, but I don't care
- you could give him consequentialist arguments, but that dont matter to him as well

The only way to get that psychopath to act in a decent way is through threats of punishment or reward.

This is why we have prisons, fines, executions.

This is just a way of introducing an idea argued by David Hume and other philosophers that In order to get morality off the ground, in order to be motivated to do good things and not bad things, you need to have some spark of feelings. You need to have other people have to matter to you. If not, you're no better then the psychopath.

We can also turn the above around and say, since most people have morality, we must have some spark of compassion, we are not total psychopaths.

### Adam Smith's idea - fundamental compassion in all

The idea that people have fundamentally kind thoughts towards others, that would regard others with some degree of caring and compassion.

Unelss you are a complete psychopath, if someone close to you is in distress/suffering, you would feel some of that as well.

But where does this feeling come from? Why do we care about others?

Some believe that babies are born complete psychopaths, but that idea is not true. 
- Babies start showing signs of empathy and compassion very early

This shows that as Adam Smith claims, some compassion, some fellow feeling is part of our nature.


### Treating Strangers

Does Adam Smith's claim apply to how we treat strangers? 

Humans are an exception among primates on how we treat strangers, e.g. we all sit together in a flight peacefully.

We are able to cope with strangers, we are able to inhibit our violence, our aggression, our frustration in the presence of strangers, and that's the first observation.

Internet is a prime example of how we treat, interact, trust (product reviews, for example) people we do not know.

We do charity, and sometimes we do act we KNOW we will NEVER benefit from, ever. 
- e.g. Milgram's letter experiment: 
- more than half of the apparently "lost" letters were returned back, even accounting for things like people not depositing letters by a Nazi and other conditions.

But there's often limitation to our compassion to strangers.

Imagine this example: 
- what if we find a girl drowning in a pond, with no one to save her? would we help here? A majority of people definitely would
- What is that girl was a random girl in Africa 
- What if that girl was my daughter?

We think very differently about the above 3 categories of people

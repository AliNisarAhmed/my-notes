### The moralization switch

The starting point for appreciating that there is a distinctive part of our psychology for morality is seeing how moral judgments differ from other kinds of opinions we have on how people ought to behave. 

Moralization is a psychological state that can be turned on and off like a switch, and when it is on, a distinctive mind-set commandeers our thinking. 
    - This is the mind-set that makes us deem actions immoral (“killing is wrong”), rather than merely disagreeable (“I hate brussels sprouts”), unfashionable (“bell-bottoms are out”) or imprudent (“don’t scratch mosquito bites”)

1. The first hallmark of moralization is that the rules it invokes are felt to be universal. Prohibitions of rape and murder, for example, are felt not to be matters of local custom but to be universally and objectively warranted. 
    - One can easily say, “I don’t like brussels sprouts, but I don’t care if you eat them,” but no one would say, “I don’t like killing, but I don’t care if you murder someone.”
2. The other hallmark is that people feel that those who commit immoral acts deserve to be punished. 
    - Not only is it  allowable to inflict pain on a person who has broken a moral rule; it is wrong  not  to, to “let them get away with it.”  
    - People are thus untroubled in inviting divine retribution or the power of the state to harm other people they deem immoral. 
    - Bertrand Russell wrote, “The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists —  that is why they invented hell"


Much of our recent social history, including the culture wars between liberals and conservatives, consists of the moralization or amoralization of particular kinds of behavior. 
- Even when people agree that an outcome is desirable, they may disagree on whether it should be treated as a matter of preference and prudence or as a matter of sin and virtue. 
    - Rozin notes, for example, that smoking has lately been moralized. 
    - Until recently, it was understood that some people didn’t enjoy smoking or avoided it because it was hazardous to their health. But with the discovery of the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, smoking is now treated as immoral.
- At the same time, many behaviors have been amoralized, switched from moral failings to lifestyle choices.
    - They  include divorce, illegitimacy, being a working mother, marijuana use and homosexuality.
- The reason for the double standards in what people moralize and what they do not is obvious: people tend to align their moralization with their own lifestyles
    - whether an activity flips our mental switches to the “moral” setting isn’t just a matter of how much harm it does. 
    - We don’t show contempt to the man who fails to change the batteries in his smoke alarms or takes his family on a driving vacation, both of which multiply the risk they will die in an accident. 
    - Driving a gas-guzzling Hummer is reprehensible, but driving a gas-guzzling old Volvo is not; eating a Big Mac is unconscionable, but not imported cheese or crème brûlée.

### Reasoning & Rationalizing 

It’s not just the content of our moral judgments that is often questionable, but the way we arrive at them. We like to think that when we have a conviction, there are good reasons that drove us to adopt it.

**People don’t generally engage in moral reasoning, but moral rationalization: they begin with the conclusion, coughed up by an unconscious emotion, and then work backward to a plausible justification.**
- examples 
    - a brother-sister couple doing incest sex without informing anyone, using double contraception
    - A woman using old american flag as a rag to clean the house
    - a family dog dies and the family eats the dead dog meat
- Most people would find the above morally wrong, but they would not be able to explain why they find it wrong

In the trolley problem, most people agree to divert the train to kill 1 person vs 5, but do not agree to push the fat man on the track to save 5. 
 - One explanation is: evolution equipped people with a revulsion to manhandling an innocent person. 
     - This instinct tends to overwhelm any utilitarian calculus that would tot up the lives saved and lost. 
     - The impulse against roughing up a fellow human would explain other examples in which people abjure killing one to save many, like euthanizing a hospital patient to harvest his organs and save five dying patients in need of transplants, or throwing someone out of a crowded lifeboat to keep it afloat.
 -  our non-utilitarian intuitions come from the victory of an emotional impulse over a cost-benefit analysis.

### Universal Morality?

Just like according to Noam Chomsky, we are born with a “universal grammar” that forces us to analyze speech in terms of its grammatical structure, with no conscious awareness of the rules in play. 

By analogy, we are born with a universal moral grammar that forces us to analyze human action in terms of its moral structure, with just as little awareness.

The idea that the moral sense is an innate part of human nature is not far-fetched. A list of human universals  
collected by the anthropologist Donald E. Brown includes many moral concepts and emotions, including 
- a distinction between right and wrong; 
- empathy; 
- fairness; 
- admiration of generosity; 
- rights and obligations;
- proscription of murder, rape and other forms of violence; 
- redress of wrongs; 
- sanctions for wrongs against the community; 
- shame; 
- and taboos.

Though no one has identified genes for morality, there is circumstantial evidence they exist. 
- The character traits called “conscientiousness” and “agreeableness” are far more correlated in identical  twins separated at birth (who share their genes but not their environment) than in adoptive siblings raised together (who share their environment but not their genes)

The moral sense, may be rooted in the design of the normal human brain

Though psychopathy probably comes from a genetic predisposition, a milder version can be caused by damage to frontal regions of the brain (including the areas that inhibit intact people from throwing the hypothetical fat man off the bridge).

But, an example that illustrates the morality cannot be all that universal, is blasphemy.

Of course, languages vary, too. In Chomsky’s theory, languages conform to an abstract blueprint, like having  
phrases built out of verbs and objects, while the details vary, like whether the verb or the object comes first. Could we be wired with an abstract spec sheet that embraces all the strange ideas that people in different cultures moralize?

Primary colors of moral sense across culture: (identified by J. Haidt)
1. harm
2. fairness 
3. community (or group loyalty)
4. authority 
5. purity

All the five above have evidence backing them from theory of evolution as well. But how they are ranked in importance, and which is brought in to moralize which area of social life  —  sex, government, commerce, religion, diet and so on  —  depends on the culture.

### Is morality a figment?

The scientific outlook has taught us that some parts of our subjective experience are products of  
our biological makeup and have no objective counterpart in the world. 
- The qualitative difference between red and green, the tastiness of fruit and foulness of carrion, the scariness of heights and prettiness of flowers are design features of our common nervous system, and if our species had evolved in a different ecosystem or if we were missing a few genes, our reactions could go the other way. 
- Now, if the distinction between right and wrong is also a product of brain wiring, why should we believe it is any more real than the distinction between red and green? 
- And if it is just a collective hallucination, how could we argue that evils like genocide and slavery are wrong for everyone, rather than just distasteful to us?

Putting God in charge of morality is one way to solve the problem, of course, but Plato made short work of it 2,400 years ago. 
- Does God have a good reason for designating certain acts as moral and others as immoral? 
    - If not  —  if his dictates are divine whims  —  why should we take them seriously? 
    - Suppose that God commanded us to torture a child. 
        - Would that make it all right, or would some other standard give us reasons to resist? 
        - And if, on the other hand,  God was forced by moral reasons to issue some dictates and not others  —  if a command to torture a child was never an option  —  then why not appeal to those reasons directly?

This throws us back to wondering where those reasons could come from, if they are more than just figments of our brains. 
- They certainly aren’t in the physical world like wavelength or mass. The only other option is that moral  
truths exist in some abstract Platonic realm, there for us to discover, perhaps in the same way that mathematical truths (according to most mathematicians) are there for us to discover. This idea is called **Moral Realism**
- On this analogy, we are born with a rudimentary concept of number, but as soon as we build on it with formal mathematical reasoning, the nature of mathematical reality forces us to discover some truths and not others. (No one who understands the concept of two, the concept of four and the concept of addition can come to any conclusion but that 2 + 2 = 4.) 
- Perhaps we are born with a rudimentary moral sense, and as soon as we build on it with moral reasoning, the nature of moral reality forces us to some conclusions but not others.

Two features of reality point any rational, self-preserving social agent in a moral direction. And they could provide a benchmark for determining when the judgments of our moral sense are aligned with morality itself.
1. One is the prevalence of non-zero-sum games. In many arenas of life, two parties are objectively better off if they both act in a nonselfish way than if each of them acts selfishly.
    - Granted, I might be a bit better off if I acted selfishly at your expense and you played the sucker, but the  same is true for you with me, so if each of us tried for these advantages, we’d both end up worse off.
2. The other external support for morality is a feature of rationality itself: that it cannot depend on the egocentric vantage point of the reasoner.
    - If I appeal to you to do anything that affects me  —  to get off my foot, or tell me the time or not run me over with your car  —  then I can’t do it in a way that privileges my interests over yours ) if I want you to take me seriously.
    -  Unless I am Galactic Overlord, I have to state my case in a way that would force me to treat you in kind. I can’t act as if my interests are special just because I’m me and you’re not, any more than I can persuade you that the spot I am standing on is a special place in the universe just because I happen to be standing on it.
    -  The core of this idea, - the interchangeability of perspectives - keeps reappearing in history's best thought thorugh moral philosophies, including the Golden Rule. 


Morality, then, is still something larger than our inherited moral sense, and the new science of the moral sense does not make moral reasoning and conviction obsolete. At the same time, its implications for our moral universe are profound.

Far from debunking morality, then, the science of the moral sense can advance it, by allowing us to see through the illusions that evolution and culture have saddled us with and to focus   on goals we can share and defend.

As Anton Chekhov wrote, “Man will become better when you show him what he is like."

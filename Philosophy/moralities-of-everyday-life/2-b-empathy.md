# Empathy & Concern

Where does compassion in humans come from?
- maybe we are related to other people whom we show compassion?
- some religious code?
- But most likely, we are wired up to care about other people

Empathy plays an important role in driving compassion, and driving morality.
- This idea is found in Adam Smith
- He gives an example, where if someone is about to get hurt, we wince just looking at the scene

Our propensity to imitate others, in actions, facial expressions, body language, verbally, physically, also drives empathy.

The fact that empathetic connections with individuals boost up your feelings towards them is the spark of an effect called _identifiable victim effect_.
- the idea that we care a lot more when there's a person in from of us than some numbers.
- "A single death is tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic"
- "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will"

Empathy drives compassion, both at individual level but also at the group level too.
- normalizing gay people in TV shows changed people's opinion of them
- Reading fictional accounts of how slaves felt helped reduced slavery

In support of this, we could look at what's wrong with people who don't care about other people, called psychopaths.
- they tend to be selfish, callous, impulsive, promiscuous

In an experiment, psychopaths were shown faces of people who were either happy, sad, angry, surprised, afraid, disguted
- Psychopaths had trouble identifying only one emotion, fear!
- Psychopaths have this specific deficit, empathizing with the fear of other people.


# Empathy & its limits

A complete theory of our moral life has to draw upon empathy
- But there are limits to empathy which make it unreliable and untenable as a complete source for morality.

Empathy is biased
- we feel a lot more affection and empathy towards kitten vs pigs, panda vs chicken.
- Juries have been found to be particularly biased in favor of good looking baby-faced criminals.
- This is not because of our deep moral argument about suffering and feelings
- It's coz some things are adorable, some things trigger our emotions.

But part of what it is to be a moral person is sometimes overriding this fact.

Nobody thinks, say for a list of people waiting in line for a heart transplant, you should walk and look at all of them and whoever inspires your feelings the most you should give em the heart transplant first.
- It's not right because what inspires your feelings has to do with things like attractiveness and baby-facedness and whether the person's the same color, whether the person same background as you.
- What you want to do to have a moral system is, you have a system that, that, that doesn't take certain things into account. That is based on reason and not gut feelings. 
- Now, these are examples where empathy is biased and empathy could lead you astray.

Empathy is limited: 
- Many people love their pets & babies without trying to empathize with them

As Steven Pinker writes: 

"""
I can't say that it's empathy that prevents me from taking out contracts on my critics, getting the fistfights over parking spaces, or threatening my wife when she points out I've dong something silly.

My mind doesn't stop and ponder what it would be like to be the victims of these kind of violence and then recoil after feeling the victim's pain.

Rather, my mind never goes in those directions in the first place.
"""

New Testament says you should love your neightbour
- but we dont love all of our neighbours
- yet we are moral towards them

The importance of moral principles, the importance of moral reason, and the limits of gut feelings, are nicely illustrated by this Adam Smith example: 
- Most of the people would be indifferent upon hearing that a 1000 people have died in a far away land
- compared to hearing the news that a loved, or you, is going to lose their finger tomorrow
- but no one in his right mind would accept the offer to save their finger by sacrificing the 1000 lives.
- no one would trade the offer of increasing their internet speed for those 1000 distant lives

What a sophisticated morality is goes beyond gut feelings and selfish urges and desires to help people. 
- But it also includes an understanding that we are but one of the multitude, in no respect better than any other in it.
- And what you see in moral systems all around the world, from religion, from philosophy, is an appreciation that a moral code doesn't care about you as special. A moral code says, you're not special.
- It says that we have to figure out how to live our lives in a way that would somehow apply to everybody.

An appreciation of both the power of the emotions and the power of reason and rationality leads us to I think a more sophisticated understanding of what goes on in our moral lives.

#  Disgust

Paul Rozzen, who's the world's leading scholar, in a study of disgust, describes it as the body and soul of emotion.

Disgust is a human universal. It shows up in every culture.

You can see it showing up in people's faces. So, wherever you are when you're shown something disgusting, you'll make the classic face. It starts with ugh, and what will elicit this face, wherever you are, is the same sorts of things.

Feces, urine, blood, vomit, rotten flesh, and most meat. When you're disgusted by something,

You don't want to touch it. You, don't want to smell it, and you certainly don't want to eat it.


Evolutionary psychologists, interested in emotions, have argued that this feeling evolved for a certain function.

It evolved to motivate us, to avoid parasites and poisons. 

So you think of the things that we are disgusted by, and they share certain things in common. 

And what they share in common is that, they are dangerous to us, but they aren't dangerous to us like a, a charging lion is dangerous to us or, or steep cliff, rather they could poison us, they, they have infectious properties.

Not only things, but people may find other people as disgusting, like jews for nazis, or hindus for south asian muslims.


Every genocidal movement that, that has left a record, exhibits signs that disgust was used, to elicit hatred towards the despised group. 
- Most movements involving prejudice and discrimination, don't just say those people, they're rotten, they're stupid, they're mean.
- They also say, they're disgusting.
- This is an insight that the philosopher Martha Nessbaum, nicely summarizes. 
    - Throughout history, certain disgust properties, sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness, have repeatedly and monotonously been associated with Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower class people.
    - All of those are imagined as tainted, by the dirt of the body.


It turns out that, that your disgust sensitivity is related to certain interesting facts about you.

Women, on average, are more disgust sensitive, than men. 
- there's, there's evidence that women become particularly disgust sensitive, at a certain vulnerable point in pregnancy.

Political conservatives, tend to be more disgust sensitive, than political liberals.

One study to actually measure the effect of disgust on behaviour: 
- people give different answers to questions like do they support homosexuals based on if a fart spray has been spread in the room they are being interviewed in.

Disgust makes you harsher towards moral violations, you could called purity violations. 
- Like consensual incest or or masturbation in an inappropriate place or stuff like that.
- If you're disgusted, you're more disapproving.


Examples on disgust influencing moral judgements: 
- brother & sister having discreet sex with protection
    - This is disgusting
    - This is wrong (My opinion)
- Family dog dies, family eats it 
    - This is disgusting 
    - This is not wrong (My opinion)
- Cleaning the toilet with a Canadian flag
    - This is disgusting 
    - But not wrong (My opinion)
- Man buys a frozen full chicken, has sex with it, and then eats it 
    - This is disgusting 
    - and it is wrong (because you should not fuck with dead things, my opinion)

But as J Haidt points out, people often struggle to find explanation of why the above examples are wrong.
- And he argues, they're unwilling to sort of come to terms with the fact that, there isn't really a reason, in the normal sense, for their repugnance.
- Rather, their reaction is because these things disgust them. 
- And because they're disgusting, they're found to be immoral. 
- And if he's right, this would be a case where, our emotions and not our reason, are driving moral judgment.

When people are shown bodies of people along with their face, it has two effect on their reasoning about them: 
1. We show more care about them, we thing they are more vilnerable to pain
2. We also tend to deny them moral agency

^ Same effect happens when we see people with full clothes vs naked


So, why do naked people, why do bodies, have this sort of effect on us?

- And there are different explanations. One explanation is, that, they inspire lust.
    - And lust somehow blocks certain morals. Sentiment makes you think about a person a different way.
- Another possibility, that is sort of separate from lust, is that if you see somebody without clothes.
        - They're more like an animal, they lose their dignity. They lose their status. 
        - And it's that which is driving the effect.


People moral judgements about things (like date rape) tends to change as they are more aroused.

^This illustrates that emotions, not just disgust, but other emotions like lust can change our moral psychology.

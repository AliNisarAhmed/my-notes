# Reasons vs Emotions

Many experimental psychologists and developmental psychologists and social psychologists have been very excited at the idea of framing the psychological question in terms of the philosophical question.

So, one way to think about people is that we're, sort of, common sense moral philosophers.

We, think about morality. We, have a sense of morality.

We have an unconscious theory of what's right and wrong.

And then the question is, what kind of moral philosophers are we?

There's been a lot of research asking the question, are people, in their gut, consequentialists? or are people deontologic, deontological thinkers? Are they Kantians?

## Trolley Problem

One thought experiment to test that is the [Trolley Problem](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/), developed in its initial form by Philippa Foot

Most people would agree to pull the switch to kill 1 person, but would not agree to push the fat man to save 5 lives, why? What does this experiment tell us?

The people that do this research will, will tell you that, one thing it suggests is that we're NOT consequentialists. because notice these cases are, kind of similar.

#### Doctrine of Double Effect 

One theory is that we have in our brains, unconsciously usually, a rather subtle philosophical principle and this principle is sometimes called the [**Doctrine of Double Effect**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/).
- According to the principle of double effect, sometimes it is permissible to cause a harm as a side effect (or “double effect”) of bringing about a good result even though it would not be permissible to cause such a harm as a means to bringing about the same good end (directly).


Suppose there's a weapons factory, which if you bomb, would result in the warring country laying down arms and surrender, but bombing the factory will kills dozens of innocent workers in it, will you do it?
- Most people say yes

Now compare to another case, where if you blow up several dozen innocent people (same number as in above example), that will terrorize the nation and will stop them from fighting, will you do it now?
- Most people now say No

And the Doctrine of Double Effect says, the difference is, in the case where you may do it, the innocents are collateral damage, but you don't want them to die. They're just a regrettable byproduct. But here, you're killing people in order to bring about an effect and you shouldn't do that.

### People as Moral philosophers vs Emotional beings 

This approach of treating people as moral philosophers and uses abstract philosophical theories as a way to make sense of our deepest intuitions and judgements, has been very influential.

But it's not the only way to do moral psychology. and in fact there has been a recent backlash against this approach

We should not think of people as, as these philosophical creatures doing these abstract rules, rather moral, morality is driven to a large extent by gut feelings.

David Brooks writes this, in his book The Social Animal: 
- Think of what happens when you put a new food into your mouth. You don't have to decide if it's disgusting. You just know. 
- You don't have to decide if a landscape is beautiful. You just know.
- Moral judgments are like that.
- They are rapid intuitive decisions and involve the emotional-processing parts of the brain. 
- Most of us make snap moral judgments about what feels fair or not or what feels good or not.
- We start doing this when we are babies, before we have language, and even as adults, we don't, we often can't explain to ourselves why something feels wrong.

J Haidt writes, reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction generated after a judgment has been reached. And Haidt has recently written a book summarizing his view, called The Righteous Mind.

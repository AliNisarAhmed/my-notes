# Different Philosophical approaches to morality

## Consequentialism

When it comes to morality, when it comes to being a good person, to being moral. Results matter.

That is why they call consequentialism.

Consequences matter. 

And what you should do is, you should always act in a way that's going to promote the best consequences, that's going to make the world better. 

What it is to do good, is to make the world better.

What it is to do bad, is to make the world worse.

What to we mean by better or worse? For **Jeremy Bentham**, it meant pleasure or pain.
- Sometimes when people define pleasure, they use the term utility, that's why this is also called utilitarianism
    - but in reality utlitarianism is a sub-category of consquentialism
- He says, nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters. Pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do.

How to decide what action to do or not to do? 
- What you're supposed to do is calculate, how many people or how many animals are going to be affected by what you do? Both negatively and positively?
- How intensely are they affected? And you kind of add everything up for one option, and you add everything up for your other options. 
- And then you choose the action that's going to produce the greatest overall amount of good.

So, is torture ok?
- for a consequentialist, it depends on the consequences
- if torturing someones saves the lives of 100 people, then torture is ok

Is homosexuality ok?
- since there is no harm to anyone else by it, and the two consenting adults are having pleasure, hence it is ok

Consequentialism is a very radical view, especially at its time, because there's nothing to be said about God here, or divine rules.

### Problems

Critics of consenquentialism point out that it often forces us to accept as moral, things that intuitively in our gut, just awful. So for a consenquentialist for instance it is perfectly, it is a good thing to torture a child to death. If by doing so, you raise the happiness level of other people.

Because the math works out. Over all, torturing leaves the world a better place than without the torturing.

But, that seems wrong.

Consequentialists give no special credit to bonds of family and friendship. And in that way as well, their account. It's a counter intuitive theory.

If your son needs an operation, and you have some money saved up for that, as per consequentialists, you should not spend it to save your son, if you can spend that money to save the lives of 100s of people.

Some consequentialists would say, you know, that really is true.
- We really should not be spending money on our own children.
- We really should be willing to torture the child to save others.
- We just have to bite the bullet and accept that sometimes our moral theories, will go beyond our intuitions will tell us things we didn't yet know.
- But many people, including me, find these consequences of consequentialists, so outlandish that it's hard to accept it fully as a moral theory.


There's another problem. This problem is in a sense more general.

It's that consequentialism might, in some way, miss the point of morality. So, why is rape wrong?

Consequentialists agree that violent rape, that rape is wrong, morally wrong.
- But here's why they think it's wrong. 
- They think it's wrong because typically in an act of rape, the suffering of the victim.
- The person who is raped, outweighs the pleasure of the rapist. And so it's wrong.
- But, if you think about it, that seems absurd. 
- That implies, for instance, that as a rapist gets more and more pleasure, rape would become more and more okay. 
- It implies that if there are multiple rapists who got great pleasure from the act. And the victim, perhaps was unconscious and didn't suffer that much, Then rape would be okay.
- And this isn't an outlandish conclusion. Because it seems to miss the point. 

Which is what's wrong about, about a crime like rape or, or, or murder or torture isn't that it just affects the sort of, qquilibrium, the relative ratio of pleasure and pain. 
- Rather it, it's because you shouldn't do that to somebody. It's that people have a right not to be harmed. It's that, it's, there's a wrongness to assaulting somebody, that transcends the balance of pain and pleasure.

The critics of consequentialism say that although it may be, to some extent, a reasonable guide to how to live your life. It fails as a moral theory, because it fails to capture what's most important about morality.\

## Deontological approaches

These approaches differ in a lot of ways, But what they share is the idea that there are moral constraints in some actions, regardless of the consequences. 

There are moral rules that apply even if it turned out an action causes more pleasure than pain. Still, some of those actions are just plain wrong.

The great champion of deontological approaches is Immanuel Kant

### hypothetical vs categorical Imperative

A lot of what we do is grounded in our desires. 
- e.g. If you want to watch a movie, what you should do is buy a ticket
- These are hypothetical imperatives

Categorical imperatives, OTOH, are grounded solely on reason: 
- Any rational being will appreciate that what you should do, is act as if your action would become a universal law. 
- So when you decide to do, to do this versus do that. You should ask yourself, if everybody did this versus that? How would the world be?
 
So, lying is wrong because, if everyone started doing it, then societies would collapse, hence no individual should EVER lie. 

Now, one of the merits, one of the strengths of, deontological approaches. Is that, unlike the consequentialist approach, they really do sort of have the flavor of morality. 
- They, they capture the idea that some things are wrong, intrinsically. 
- You don't just add up pain and pleasure.

### Problems

These categorical rules often seem crazy. 

Like always NOT lying
- what if lying saves a life?
- and isn't there another categorical imperative that should say that we should always act in order to save other lives? 
- which imperative takes precedence?

Another problem is, where do all these morals come from? Kant would insist they come from pure reason and rationality.
- The critics of Kant, and the critics of deotological philosophers say, you know, these aren't grounded in rationality. 
- These are actually grounded in your own prejudices and biases & emotions. 
- So, for instance, Kant thought homosexuality was wrong. Kant also thought masturbation was wrong.
- What he said of both of these is, they're violations of ones duty to ones self, not to succumb to animal desires. 
- And he found that convincing. 
- But many people don't find it convincing. 
- And it's not clear that there is a way to convince somebody who doesn't think that, that these things are wrong, that they are.


And so, so the consequentialist starts with an intuitive place. The goodness of pleasure and the badness of pain.

The deontological philosopher, struggles a little bit more trying to find a way to ground these abstract rules.

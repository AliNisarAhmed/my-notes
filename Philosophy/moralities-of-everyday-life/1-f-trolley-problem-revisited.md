# Trolley Problem revisited

An alternative explanation to Doctrine of Double effect was proposed by Joshua Green.

The alternative says, that's not what's happening at all, there is not just reason behind the decision to not push the fat man, but emotions.

When patients' brains were analyzed, the pushing the fat man case elicited more emotional parts of the brain to respond, compared to the 5v1 trolley problem where only logical reasoning part of the brain were triggered.

Green says, there's two aspects of our moral psychology: 
1. Controlled rational processes, often very utilitarian
2. Automatic, involuntary, gut feeling, often very emotional

For the bridge case, emotions light up.
- It's not just a cold blooded calculation one and five, but also this gut feeling. 
- And the gut feeling lights up for green. Not because of any principle or structure.
- it's the idea that this visceral feeling of putting your hands on somebody and shoving, causes emotional response.
- That's what's driving it.
- It has nothing to do with the doctrine of double effect, or anything like that.
- It's an emotional response to the physicality of pushing somebody to his death.

If instead of pushing, there's was a switch that controlled a trap door through which the fat man can fall, the people become much more likely to push the switch.

If people have previously been in a funny mood (like watching a lot of funny videos) they become much more likely to push the fat man.

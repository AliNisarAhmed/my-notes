# What is morality

1. There's no definition of morality that people, or even philosophers agree on
    -  Elliot Turiel, who's done significant work in the psychology of morality, defines morality in a pretty narrow way in terms of justice, rights, and harm. For him, something only counts as immoral if there's a victim, if someone suffers.
    -  Jonathan Haidt, has a much broader definition of morality. For him, anything that suppresses self-interest and makes cooperation possible is part of morality. So for Haidt, a religious ritual might be part of our moral psychology, part of our moral life. For Turiel it wouldn't be.
2. Beginning with a definition is not a good idea when you are dealing with scientific questions.
    - what we do is begin with a rough idea of what we are talking about, and then our understanding what counts as falling within that domain shifts as a result of evolution of understanding.
    - So you might say, you know, we used to think that this was cancer, but now we know it isn't.

So, what's the rough idea of morality?

There are some signature properties that are associated with morality. 
- it's a morals violations way to harm, to helping, to pain, 
- It's related to notions of reward and punishment. 
- Good things are rewarded and bad things are punished and it's related to emotion such as guilt, shame anger and gratitude.
- So for one thing, you don't have to, make physical contact to somebody, in order to do something wrong. Most of us would believe it's wrong to shout a racist insult at somebody, or threaten to kill them, or spread lies about them. You could harm people in ways that aren't physical.
- You could be immoral by negligence. e.g. failing to feed your infant
- Now there are some cases where What counts as immoral is different from what counts as illegal
- not all moral violations involve victims. Or least they don't always involve victims in clear and obvious sense.
    - Homosexuality used to be illegal
    - consensual cannibalism

All the above examples tell us that scope of morality is broad.

What could be a point of pride to one could be a point of disgust to another.
- most people have moral restrictions on what they eat
    - some derive them from religions 
    - some have concerns about animal suffering 
    - or damage to ecosystem

The most obvious cases of morality, involve family and friends. So, we feel moral obligation towards our family and friends, we feel gratitude when people do right by us, betrayed if they don't.

Morality applies to strangers as well. Many of us give to charity and many of us give to charity to help people we don't know and who will never help us back.

Adams Smith's two questions on origins of morality: 
1. How should we live? what is it to be a good person? What is it to be a virtuous person? (This is more of a philosophical question)
2. How and by what means does it come to pass that a mind prefers on tenor of conduct to another? He's asking what's going on in our minds and our brains that causes us to say somethings good and something's bad? (this is more of a psychological question)

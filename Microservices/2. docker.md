## Docker Commands

Running Containers
- `docker run <imagename> <startupCommand>` - download an image if not found locally and start a container for that image
- `docker run` is a combination of two commands, `docker create <imagename>` which creates a container, and `docker start -a <containerId>` which starts the created container. 
    - `-a` flag tells docker to capture any output from the container and print it.
- Port Forwarding at runtime
    - `docker run -p <localhostPort>:<portInsideContainer> <imageId|imageName>` 

Delete containers
- `docker system prune` - delete stopped containers and build cache

Check logs
- `docker logs <containerId>` - get all the logs emitted by the container (even stopped ones)

Stopping or Killing containers
- `docker stop <containerId>` to gracefully stop a container (grace period 10 secs) 
- `docker kill <containerId` to insta kill a container

For Running Command inside a running Docker container
   - `docker exec -it <containerId> <commands>`
       - `-it` flag attaches our terminal to the `stdin` of the container
       - the `-t` flag is there to beautify the text interaction

Open a Shell inside a running container
    - `docker exec -it <containerId> sh`
    - Can also directly start with a shell inside a container 
        - `docker run -it <containerId> sh`

Build from a Dockerfile: 
- `docker build .`
- Build with a tag
    - `docker build -t <tag> . ` where tag is in format: userId/(Repo|ProjectName):version

Create an image out of a running container with a default command
    - `docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"] <containerId>'` (On windows `docker commit -c "CMD 'redis-server' <containerId>"`)
